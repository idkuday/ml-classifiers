This repository has a few of the machine learning algorithms that I have implemented.
It includes 4 variant models of Baye's Classifer, K-Nearest Neighbours and nearest neighbour classifier, which have been coded from scratch, and a Gaussian Mixture Model which uses Scikit Learn Modules.
The datasets were of three types: Linearly Separable, Non-Linear and Overlapping. Each classifier of course had its merits and demerits which was evident due to the varying datasets.
